# PracticeSchoolProject

This project is an effort to make defect detection in vehicles using Image classification techniques: -

1. Detecting defects in vehicles using Transfer Learning.
2. Developing the website which supports uploading images of car directly from system/camera.The site predicts whether the image of car uploaded is defective or not.


For using this project, the user needs to : - 
1. Download all the necessary libraries mentioned in the readme.docx into their device.
2. The user need to have their relevant data set to generate the model files.
3. All the necessary changes which are required to be made for creating the models are mentioned in the jupyter notebook and also in the readme.docx file. 

**Note that** : The actual problem statement is different from our final project. Due to confidentiality of the orignal dataset we had to work on a toy dataset . This website was created only for demonstration of the functionalities of the final site required by the organization.
